----CSGO Trade up Profit Calculator-----
------Author: Piotr Rajchel, 2020-------
--------------Ver.1.0-------------------

This program will tell you the percentage
of profitability a trade-up contract has
based on your inputs.

Information to keep in mind:

	1. This program takes in limited inputs, please don't include symbols
           such as $ or % when entering numbers. Both should be in ##.## format.

        2. To find out how much each item costs and yields for being sold,
           check the steam market for the most current values. This program
           will account for the market tax, so just enter the number that's
           listed per item.
        3. To get the chances for profit or loss, use a tradeup site such
           as https://csgo.exchange/contract/tradeup. Remember the steam prices
           of each of these items relative to their chance, because the chance
           will be asked after the list of prices is input.
